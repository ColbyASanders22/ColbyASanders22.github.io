    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

    <div class="text-box">
        <h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft:</a></h3>
        <p>The Microsoft website has a sleek and professional look that fits the brand
            and overall target audience. Navigation through the website is simple and effective
            which allows for many different types of consumers to find there way around with ease.
            The use of white space, differents fonts/bold text make the cite easy to understand
            and follow. 
        </p>
        <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The website overall contrast well with each other
                and allows for important links and or buttons to stand out against there
                backgrounds. The darker color text consistently contrast well with its lighter 
                colored background as well.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Repitition: The fonts are consistent and work well together.
                    The branding is also fluent and the color pallet remains the same across pages.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Alignment: The content is clear and aligned well. The nav bar is aligned
                    horizontally and all items are evenly spaced. None of the following look
                    like they are about to flow off the page because of a lack of padding.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Proximity: All of the related text and buttons appear to be grouped together,
                     which makes the information easy to see. The styles all work well together 
                     which helps create that visual seperation so nothing appears to be too close or
                     overcrowded.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href="https://www2.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a></h3>
                <p>The Pacific Northwest X-Ray website looks incredibly outdated and cluttered, 
                    which makes it difficult to read and navigate. The background is distracting, the text is inconsistent, 
                    is poorly organized in general.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The text blends into the gradient blue background, which makes it difficult to read.
                    The background is also distracting in general, the text is inconsistent, and layout is 
                    poorly organzied.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Repitition: There is not much consistency in the design.
                    Fonts, text sizes, and colors are all pretty different which 
                    makes the website lack flow.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Alignment: The layout looks messy and lacks direction. The text, images,
                     and buttons are all scattered randomly. Nothing is directly and aligned so everything seems 
                     "off", which makes the site difficult to read and understand.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Proximity: The items that are related to each other are not grouped well. The search bar, 
                    nav bar, and product links are all spaced weirdly, which makes the page feel cluttered 
                    and disorganized. Important elements are spaced far apart, then others are closer together.
                </li>
            </ul>
