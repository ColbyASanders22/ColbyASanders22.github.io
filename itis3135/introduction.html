<p>Hello! My name is Colby Sanders and I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity. I am 23 years old and originally from Raleigh, North Carolina. I lived in Charlotte for a year in 2020, then moved back a year ago. After graduating I plan to pursue a Masters Degree in cybersecurity as well.</p>

<ul>
<li class="classes"><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hobbies I enjoy in my free time include going to the gym, walking my dog, playing video games, hanging out with friends, watching sports, watching moves/tv, and more!</p>

<li class="classes"><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I began my career in 2021 by working at Charlotte Beer Garden and have had various different serving jobs since then. This past summer, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do an Externship with Snapchat that consisted of us creating different AR lenses.</li>

<li class="classes"><strong>Academic Background:</strong> am currently a junior and I transferred here from Wake Tech. I am pursuing a major in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity.</li>

<li class="classes"><Strong>Courses I'm taking and why</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li class="classes">ITSC 3146 - Intro Oper Syst & Networking: I am taking this course because I am interested in networking and how everything is interconnected.</li>
<li class="classes">ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms: I am taking this course because I am curious how algorithms work as they can be extremely useful in real world applications.</li>
<li class="classes">ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web App Development: I am interested in this because I am interested in making web applications.</li>
<li class="classes">ITSC 3160 - Database Design & Implementation: I am taking this course because databases are another extremely useful tool in the real world and it is important to make sure that they are implemented properly.</li>
<li class="classes">MATH 2164 - Matrices & Linear Algebra: I am taking this course because it is a part of the curriculum. I am not a big math fan, unfortunately.</li>
</ol>
