     <h1>About Me</h1>

     <img src="images/skitrip.jpg" alt="About Me Picture" class="profile-pic">

<p>Hello! My name is Colby Sanders and I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity. I am 23 years old and originally from Raleigh, North Carolina. I lived in Charlotte for a year in 2020, then moved back a year ago. After graduating I plan to pursue a Masters Degree in cybersecurity as well.</p>

<h2>Personal Background</h2>
<p>Hobbies I enjoy in my free time include going to the gym, walking my dog, playing video games, hanging out with friends, watching sports, watching moves/tv, and more!</p>

<h2>Professional Background</h2>
<p>I began my career in 2021 by working at Charlotte Beer Garden and have had various different serving jobs since then. This past summer, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do an Externship with Snapchat that consisted of us creating different AR lenses.</p>

<h2>Academic Background</h2>
<p>I am currently a junior and I transferred here from Wake Tech. I am pursuing a major in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity.</p>

<h2>Primary Computer</h2>
<p>My primary computer is a custom built desktop running Windows 11. I typically work from my apartment.</p>

<h2>Courses I'm taking and why</h2>
<p>ITSC 3146 - Intro Oper Syst & Networking: I am taking this course because I am interested in networking and how everything is interconnected.</p>
<p>ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms: I am taking this course because I am curious how algorithms work as they can be extremely useful in real world applications.</p>
<p>ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web App Development: I am interested in this because I am interested in making web applications.</p>
<p>ITSC 3160 - Database Design & Implementation: I am taking this course because databases are another extremely useful tool in the real world and it is important to make sure that they are implemented properly.</p>
<p>MATH 2164 - Matrices & Linear Algebra: I am taking this course because it is a part of the curriculum. I am not a big math fan, unfortunately.</p>
