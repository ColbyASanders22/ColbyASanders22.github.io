    <p>I, Colby A. Sanders agree to abide by the terms of the course contract 
		in my Fall 2025, ITIS 3135, Front-end web app development with my instructor, Professor 
		D.I. von Briesen. 
	<p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly
		available online tools will be available to the world, and will not 
		put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I 
		wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts 
		for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to 
		turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given 
		the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many 
		examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly.
	</p> 
	<p>I swear 
		that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and 
		paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external 
		libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Colby A. Sanders , 
		8/31/2025
